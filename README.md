## Project Overview

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, but early detection greatly improves survival rates. **MediLab** provides a web-based platform that allows users to upload CT scan images, which are then analyzed by a machine learning model to detect early signs of lung cancer.

The goal of this application is to assist medical professionals in making more informed decisions by automating the detection process and providing them with an initial evaluation.

## Features

- **CT Scan Upload**: Upload CT scan images in DICOM or standard image formats.
- **Lung Cancer Detection**: Automated detection of potential cancerous nodules using state-of-the-art machine learning models.
- **Prediction Confidence**: Displays confidence levels for detected nodules.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps or bounding boxes highlight areas of interest in the CT scan for better interpretability.
- **Report Generation**: Generates downloadable reports for medical professionals.
- **User Management**: Secure login for healthcare professionals and patient data management.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users can upload a CT scan image (DICOM, JPG, PNG).
2. **Pre-processing**: The image undergoes preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
3. **Prediction**: A trained convolutional neural network (CNN) processes the CT scan and predicts whether cancerous nodules are present.
4. **Visualization**: The areas of interest (potential cancerous nodules) are highlighted using heatmaps or bounding boxes.
5. **Results**: The results are displayed with a confidence score, and a downloadable report can be generated.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medilab-lung-cancer-detection.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd medilab-lung-cancer-detection
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - Using pip (for Python):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Or, using npm (for frontend):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Run the web application**:
   - Start the backend (e.g., Flask/Django):
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Start the frontend (if applicable):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

5. **Open in browser**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the application.

## Usage

1. **Log in** to the application using your credentials (if secure login is implemented).
2. **Upload a CT scan** image of the patient.
3. The system will **analyze** the image and detect potential lung cancer nodules.
4. **View the results**:
   - Confidence scores for potential lung cancer.
   - Areas of interest highlighted on the CT scan.
5. **Download a report** for further medical evaluation or diagnosis.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js (or other JavaScript frameworks)
- **Backend**: Flask/Django (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for model implementation
- **Data Processing**: OpenCV, NumPy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL for user and report management
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 for image storage (optional)
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth for secure login
